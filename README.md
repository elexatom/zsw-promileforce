# PromileForce
Team project for KIV/ZSW-E course.
The goal of your work will be to assemble, using components and a Raspberry Pi Lite, a distance-measuring sensor system that transmits the measured data to a mobile application in real time via Bluetooth.
For the implementation of the project, you will be provided with three measuring sensors: one ultrasonic sensor and two laser sensors. Your task will be to assemble the device and implement the software that displays the measured values in a mobile application.
The mobile application also needs to be implemented; the requirements for it are minimal. It is sufficient if the application displays the measured distance and the sensor from which the value is obtained.
Please note that at least two sensors must be able to operate simultaneously.
Project objectives:
Assemble a distance-measuring device using a Raspberry Pi Lite
Implement software on the Raspberry Pi to read sensor data and transmit the measured values in real time via Bluetooth.
Develop a simple mobile application
